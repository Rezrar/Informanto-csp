# **Informanto Discord Bot**  

## **Data Collected**  
Informanto collects only the following data:  
1. **Server Profile Information**  
   - Server name and ID: Used to ensure accurate delivery of messages to the selected channels.  
   - Language preference: Set using the `/set` command to tailor the bot's functionality to your chosen language.  

2. **Command Logs**  
   - The bot logs command usage for stability, error reporting, and future improvements. These logs do not include any user-identifiable information.  

## **Data Usage**  
- Data collected by Informanto is solely used for its intended purpose: sending messages to designated channels on your server.  
- Logs are temporary and only track the performance and functionality of the bot. No user-specific details are included in these logs.  

## **Data Storage and Retention**  
- Data is stored locally on the bot and is not shared outside of the bot’s system or its database.  
- Users can delete their server data at any time using the `/unset` command. This will stop the bot from sending messages to the designated channel and remove the associated server data from storage.  

## **Your Control Over Data**  
- **Set Data**: Use the `/set` command to specify a channel for message delivery and set your language preference.  
- **Delete Data**: Use the `/unset` command to remove your server’s data from the bot.  
- **Limitations**: Messages already sent by the bot cannot currently be deleted, but this feature will be introduced in the future.  

## **Temporary Logging**  
Informanto uses temporary logs to track the successful usage of commands and interactions. These logs are automated and anonymous, ensuring no personal information about users is collected. Logging exists purely to improve the bot’s functionality and identify potential issues.  

## **How Your Data Is Protected**  
Informanto’s local storage ensures that all server data remains within the bot’s system and is not accessible externally.
